**Review Summary:**

✅ All style guide violations have been addressed with inline comments on this PR.

**Previously flagged issues that are now resolved:**
- Dockerfile: dumb-init path corrected to `/usr/bin/dumb-init` (line 65)
- Navbar.tsx: Hydration mismatch resolved (both client and server renders now consistent)

**Current violations (already flagged with comments):**
- `any` type usage in multiple files without comment explanations
- Inline error callouts in components instead of using `sonner`

**Minor observations:**
- Function `getAutonameModel` in `src/server/opencode/models.ts:128` has a typo (should be `getAutoNameModel`) but is currently unused. This is dead code that could be removed, but doesn't violate style guide rules.

**Overall assessment:**
The code changes in this PR follow the architectural guidelines in AGENTS.md well:
- Uses `pnpm` throughout
- Prefers fetch calls and Astro actions over HTML forms
- Good domain separation and file organization
- Functions have clear single purposes
- Uses Zustand for state management
- Components are properly structured
- Well-typed throughout (with minor `any` type issues that should be addressed)

The flagged violations are relatively minor but important for maintaining type safety and consistency. Once these are addressed, the PR will be in excellent shape.
