            Read and understand @AGENTS.md to learn the project's rules and conventions.
            Then analyze this codebase for any improvements that adhere to those rules.

            Focus on:
            - Clean code principles (single-purpose functions, proper abstractions, MVC patterns)
            - Following the tech stack conventions (pnpm, TypeScript strict mode, Astro + React, shadcn/ui, etc.)
            - Any rules in AGENTS.md that may need updating based on recent changes

            If you find improvements that align with AGENTS.md, and you're confident, create a PR to make those improvements.
            If you're not confident or it requires opinionated changes, or more input, create an issue instead.

            If there's an existing issue or PR tackling that same concern, do not do anything.

            If no improvements are found that align with AGENTS.md, don't do anything.
