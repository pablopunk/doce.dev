# doce.dev - Self-Hosted AI Website Builder

## To Do

- [x] template: different docker-compose for dev and prod (commands and ports should differ)
- [ ] Agent tool: cli commands
- [ ] Agent tool: todo list
- [ ] Agent tool: web requests
- [ ] Agent tool: logs (access to docker logs + container logs, just like the web terminal)
- [ ] Deployments. `astro build` + `astro preview`
- [ ] Set up reverse proxy for deployment routing (traefik?)
- [ ] Add file tree view for project navigation
- [ ] Allow to edit files in the files view
- [ ] Project state restoration from any chat message
- [ ] Multi-user support with authentication and authorization
- [ ] Git integration for version control and rollback
- [ ] Project export/import functionality
- [ ] Support for multiple frameworks (Next.js, etc.) and infra
- [ ] Different templates for specific type of apps (blog, todo-app, SaaS, dashboard, SPA tool, crazy animations, games, etc.)
- [ ] Add agent-controlled "Tasks" section to chat interface
- [x] Make design system have semantic colors. There should be zero "dark:" classes in the codebase, since there's no reason to differentiate between light and dark mode with semantic colors.
- [ ] URL bar in the preview window
- [x] Remove all semantic colors from shadcn/ui and add the ones from our design system
- [x] Add guidelines for persistance in templates/. Simple peristance can go to local storage, but for more complex stuff, it should use sqlite.
- [x] Get rid of console erros in dashboard
- [ ] Allow editing Global prompt for templates. Should be saved in settings, never replace the template AGENTS file.
- [ ] Allow inserting images in the prompt
- [ ] Add a way to insert assets into the project, e.g. images, videos, etc.
- [ ] Multiple design systems: I think having several tailwind configs / css files would be enough here. Default to one, let user choose.
- [x] Set up DB abstraction. Refactor the whole project to use a DB abstraction that then can be swapped out whenever needed. Especially useful when deploying in docker (could be deployed with a mysql DB for performance on large projects).
- [x] Add a logger library. This should be able to log different levels to console or files (or both)
- [ ] Please go model by model and fix the mess that the AI made.
- [x] Remove all imports from db outside models files (example: project id page). Maybe we can add a biome rule for this.
- [ ] Global AGENTS.md, template-independent rules, like "use pnpm", "use tailwind", etc.
  - [ ] Decide if shadcn or flowbite and add it to that AGENTS.md
  - [ ] Generic instructions for the backend. They all could use astro actions and server islands for SSR.
- [ ] Button in the file browser to add a file to the chat as context
- [ ] Fork project (fresh context)
- [ ] Compact context in chat:
  - [ ] Button to compact it
  - [ ] Mechanism to detect when compression is needed (context gets big)
- [ ] The chat mentions stuff like "open localhost:3000", which is not true for our tool; let's make it aware of how the project is deployed in dev mode
- [ ] shadcn mcp?
